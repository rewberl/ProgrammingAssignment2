## A pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## Enter the object returned from makeCacheMatrix as the argument for
## cacheSolve.

## Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## retrieves the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
